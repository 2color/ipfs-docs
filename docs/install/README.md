# Install IPFS

IPFS itself is a peer-to-peer network that relies on a set of protocols to create a distirbuted file-system. As such, there are several different ways you can install and interact with IPFS! Pick the one that best suits what you're here to do:

## Decentralized storage

IPFS can be used by anyone wanting to store data in a decentralized way. The easiest way to get up and running is by installing the IPFS Desktop application. This app has Go-IPFS built-in and lets you interact with the network through a simple interface. [Check it out →](/install/desktop-application)

## Development and IPFS

Want to build decentralized applications and store your application data on IPFS? You'll likely want to install the command-line version of IPFS. There's no GUI to deal with, just raw input and output through your terminal. [Find out more →](/install/command-line-installation)

## IPFS as infrastructure

Planning to set up several IPFS nodes within one network? You'll want to take a look at installing [IPFS Cluster →](/install/server-installation)
