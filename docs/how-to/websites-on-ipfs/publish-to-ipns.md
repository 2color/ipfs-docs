# Publish to IPNS

Using CIDs to get content is great; it means that the user always gets the content that they want. But what if the user doesn't know _what_ they're looking for, and just wants the _latest_ version of that content? This is where IPNS comes in handy.

Instead of sharing the CID of your website, you publish the root CID of your website to IPNS, and then share the _key_ you get from IPNS.
