# Basics

This section covers the basics operations and configurations that new users need when starting out with IPFS. You can find guides for the basics of running the IPFS Desktop app, interacting with IPFS through the command-line, or by running some basic JavaScript functions!

## Desktop app

Never used IPFS before? Have no idea what it is or what it's even for? You should start here. The IPFS Desktop app is a really simple way to interact with the IPFS network, and manage your local and remote files!

## Command-line

If you're a bit more serious about IPFS and want to start poking around the command-line interfact (CLI), then this section is for you. No buttons or images here; just good-old-fashioned CLI interfaces and pipeable commands.

## JavaScript

Wanna build a cool web app that uses IPFS? You'll first need to learn the basics of how IPFS works, and how to structure your JS functions to get the data you need!
